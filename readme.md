This project is a web-based sound board application[^1] that allows users to play various sound effects by clicking on buttons. The project utilizes the p5.js library[^2] for rendering the canvas and handling sound playback.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Laura-LeeHollande/interactive-soundboard.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd sound-board
    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Once the project is set up and running, you will see a web page with several buttons. Each button corresponds to a different sound effect. Click on any button to play the associated sound.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the web page.
- `sketch.js`: The main JavaScript file that contains the p5.js setup and draw functions, as well as the logic for loading and playing sounds.
- `p5.min.js`, `p5.sound.js`, `p5.sound.min.js`: The p5.js library and its sound extension.

## Code Overview

### HTML Structure

The `index.html` file sets up the basic structure of the web page, including linking to the necessary CSS and JavaScript files.

### JavaScript Logic

The `sketch.js` file contains the core logic for the sound board. Here's a brief overview of its structure:

- **Setup Function**: Initializes the canvas and loads the sound files.
- **Draw Function**: Continuously updates the canvas (though in this project, it might not be used extensively).
- **Sound Loading**: Uses the `loadSound` function from the p5.js library to load sound files.
- **Button Creation**: Dynamically creates buttons for each sound effect and assigns a click event to play the corresponding sound.

### CSS Styling

The project includes a `styles.css` file to handle the visual styling of the web page. Key elements styled include:

- **Buttons**: Styled to be visually appealing and easy to click.
- **Canvas**: Ensures the canvas is properly sized and positioned.
